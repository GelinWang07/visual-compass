A visual compass realization based on PCL, OpenCV and Eigen. This modified approach is presented to estimate the three Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) orientation of RGB-D camera in indoor environments. Here are some functions presented including: 
1. generate 3d organized point cloud
2. fiter of statistical outlier removal
3. write the cloud normals
4. get cloud normals by integral image
5. segment planes by RANSAC
